# Common

These are common files used by some projects. They are primarily used for token
related access.

## Installation

Refer to the `./example/.env` file for the required environment variables.

## Updating setup.py

This project has a `setup.py` file so that it can be imported by other modules.
This file was auto-generated by `pipenv-setup` and should be periodically
updated via:

```
pipenv run update-setup
```

## Usage

### Installing as a dependency

You can reference this package as you would other python packages.

#### Pipenv

Include this in your `Pipfile`:

```
common = {editable = true, path = "<relative_path_to>/common"}
```

### To get a raw token

> **Note**: the `create_<client>_token_accessor` takes in an optional scope.
> Each client has the appropriate defaults set for the scope, so it is not
> required to pass in a scope. Specifying an unsupported/unauthorized scope for
> the client may result in a 404 error

```python
from token_accessor.token_cache_token_accessor import
    create_generic_client_token_accessor

# Create a token accessor
token_accessor = create_generic_client_token_accessor()

# Fetch the token
token = token_accessor.get_token()

# The resulting token can be used directly via:
print(token.token)

# Alternatively, the token has a helper function to get auth HTTP headers
headers = token.get_auth_header()
```

### To use a token for a GraphQL request

```python
from token_accessor.token_cache_token_accessor import
    create_generic_client_token_accessor
from token_accessor.gql_client import GqlClient
from gql import gql

# Create a token accessor
token_accessor = create_generic_client_token_accessor()

query = gql(
    """
        query someGqlQuery(
            $some_variable: String!
        ) {
            someGqlQuery(
                some_variable: $some_variable
            ) {
                some_field
            }
        }
    """)

# Create a gql client with the token accessor, which will automatically fetch and use a token when the request is executed
gql_client = GqlClient("https://someurl.com", token_accessor)

# Execute the GraphQL query
result = gql_client.execute(
    query,
    variable_values={
        "some_variable": "some value"
    }
)
```
